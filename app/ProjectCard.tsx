              Fuelled by a passion for crafting impactful products, my journey
              into programming began with Girls Who Codeâ€”a pivotal experience that
              sparked my curiosity in tech. It wasn&apos;t until I encountered
              Bitcoin that I found my true calling. The revolutionary technology
              behind it not only captivated me but also unveiled a realm of
              exciting possibilities. Now, I&apos;m on a mission to explore this
              frontier and leverage my design skills to enhance user experiences
              in innovative ways.
